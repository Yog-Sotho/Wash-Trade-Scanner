## 2025-05-15 - Insecure DATABASE_URL construction
**Vulnerability:** Manual f-string construction of `DATABASE_URL` failed to escape special characters in passwords (e.g., '@'), leading to misparsed connection strings and potential connection failures.
**Learning:** Using `sqlalchemy.engine.URL.create` is the secure and robust way to build database URLs as it handles necessary escaping of all components.
**Prevention:** Always use dedicated library functions for URI/URL construction instead of manual string concatenation or f-strings when dealing with credentials.
